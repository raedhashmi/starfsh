              It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone 
              and access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly 
              advises against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves 
              removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the 
              official operating system of your device. Such actions could 
              expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs,

              the internet or if you have exhausted your data allowance.

              provider for data usage during the use of the Application. 
              By using the Application, you accept responsibility for 
              any such charges.

              Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume 
              responsibility for your usage of the application. For 
              instance, it is your responsibility to ensure that your 
              device remains charged. If your device runs out of 
              battery and you are unable to access the Service, 
              the Service Provider cannot be held responsible.
